# Learning Jenkins, 03-01: Install Jenkins as a Container

# Prerequisites
You will need to configure Maven as a global build tool.

In the Jenkins web interface, go to:

`Manage Jenkins` -> `Global Tool Configuration` -> `Maven installations` -> `Add Maven`.

Give your Maven installation a name and check the option to `Install automatically`.

# Setting up the Jenkins Job
Create a freestyle job and configure it as follows:

1. Add a build step using `Invoke Top-Level Maven Target`.
2. For the goal, enter `package`.
3. Add a build step to run the compiled package:
- *FOR WINDOWS*: Use the `Execute Windows batch command` build step
- FOR macOS, Linux, and Docker: Use the `Execute shell` build step
4. Enter the following command:
```
java -cp target/hello-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.learningjenkins.App
```
5. Save the job and start a build.
